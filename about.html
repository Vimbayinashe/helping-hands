            Maoko eRudo was founded in the year 2001 after hyper-inflation and consecutive droughts plunged that millions of Zimbabwean into food insecurity. As in all times of crisis, the young, the old and sick are at greater risk in society. Thus the vision for Maoko eRudo, which means <em>the hands of love</em>, was founded by Mary-Kate Musangano.
